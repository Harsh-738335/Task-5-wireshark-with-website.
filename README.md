Cybersecurity Internship Task- Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types.

# Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

# Objective:
To capture live network packets using Wireshark, identify at least three different network protocols, and analyze the types of traffic observed.

# Tools Used:
- Wireshark (Free network protocol analyzer)

# Steps Performed:
1. Installed Wireshark on the system.
2. Started live capture on the active network interface (Wi-Fi).
3. Generated network traffic by browsing websites and using the `ping` command.
4. Stopped the capture after 1 minute.
5. Applied protocol filters like `http`, `dns`, and `tcp` to isolate specific traffic types.
6. Identified and analyzed multiple protocols in the capture.
7. Exported the capture as a `.pcap` file.

# Protocols Identified:
## 1. **DNS (Domain Name System)**
- Resolves human-readable domain names  (wikipidia.com) into IP addresses.
- Observed DNS query and response packets.

## 2. **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**
- Used for loading web pages.
- Seen in packets generated by visiting websites.

## 3. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
- Ensures reliable delivery of data.
- Seen as the underlying transport layer for HTTP traffic.

# Files Included:
- network_capture.pcap– with 3 protocol --Raw captured traffic file.
- `README.md` – This report.

# Outcome:
This task helped build hands-on experience with Wireshark, packet capture, and filtering. Learned how to identify basic protocols and analyze network communication.
